# wrapFunctionAdd

 PROBLEM: INT30-C. Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not wrap

 SOLUTION: This solution performs a precondition test of the operands of the addition to guarantee there is no possibility of unsigned wrap

# wrapFunctionMul

 PROBLEM: INT30-C. Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not wrap

 SOLUTION: This solution performs a precondition test of the operands of the addition to guarantee there is no possibility of unsigned wrap

# wrapFunctionShift

 PROBLEM: INT34-C. Do not shift an expression by a negative number of bits or by greater than or equal to the number of bits that exist in the operand

 SOLUTION: This solution eliminates the possibility of shifting by greater than or equal to the number of bits that exist in the precision of the left operand
